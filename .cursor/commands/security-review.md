# Security Review

## Overview

Perform a comprehensive security review of the current code using the **Security Agent** and provide specific remediation steps with code examples for each security issue identified.

## Agent

**Use**: @Security Agent

The Security Agent performs a deep-dive manual review covering:

-   Authentication & Authorization
-   Input Validation & Sanitization
-   Data Protection
-   Next.js Security
-   Supabase Security
-   Infrastructure & CI/CD Security

**Report Location**: Results are saved to `report/security/security-review-{timestamp}.md` (timestamp format: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS)

## Steps

1. **Authentication & Authorization**

    - Verify proper authentication mechanisms
    - Check authorization controls and permission systems
    - Review session management and token handling
    - Ensure secure password policies and storage
    - Review refresh token security and rotation

2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**

    - Identify SQL injection vulnerabilities (SQLi/NoSQLi)
    - Check for XSS and CSRF attack vectors
    - Validate all user inputs and API parameters
    - Review file upload and processing security
    - Propose validation strategies (zod/yup)

3. **Data Protection**

    - Ensure sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
    - Check for data exposure in logs and error messages
    - Review API responses for information leakage
    - Verify proper secrets management (.env handling, vaults)

4. **Next.js Security**

    - Environment variables handling
    - API routes security
    - Middleware security
    - Security headers (CSP, etc.)

5. **Supabase Security**

    - RLS policies review
    - API keys management
    - Authentication flows
    - Data access patterns

6. **Infrastructure & CI/CD Security**
    - Review dependency security and known vulnerabilities
    - Check HTTPS configuration
    - Analyze CORS policies and security headers
    - Review environment variable and configuration security
    - Audit CI/CD pipeline security (secrets management, build artifacts)

# Security Review Report

**Description:** Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the security review scope and findings.

**Status:** ✅ OK for merge | ⚠️ Refused | 🔴 Blocked

## Alertes

{ONLY_LIST_ALERTS_IF_SECURITY_ISSUES_FOUND}

### 🔴 High Risk
- **Issue:** {title} - **Location:** `file:line` - **Recommandation:** {fix_with_code_diff}

### ⚠️ Medium Risk
- **Issue:** {title} - **Location:** `file:line` - **Recommandation:** {fix_with_code_diff}

### ℹ️ Low Risk
- **Issue:** {title} - **Location:** `file:line` - **Recommandation:** {fix_with_code_diff}

{IF_NO_ISSUES:}
No vulnerabilities detected. The code respects the security standards.
```

**Important:** Alerts are only listed if security issues are found. If the code is secure, the report will clearly state that no vulnerabilities were detected.

# Logging & Error System

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Labels:** setup, observability, shared, logging  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-42-logging-error-system`

## Description

Design centralized logging and error-handling utilities with log levels, correlation IDs, and structured error handling. This provides consistent observability across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have centralized logging and error-handling utilities so that I can track application behavior, debug issues, and handle errors consistently across all layers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Logging utilities created in `shared/utils/logging.ts` with log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
2. Correlation ID generation and tracking for request tracing
3. Structured error types and error handling utilities
4. Error mapping utilities for converting infrastructure errors to domain errors
5. Logging configuration and environment-based log levels

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Logging utilities in `shared/utils/` can be imported by all layers
- **Log Levels**: Support debug, info, warn, error with environment-based filtering
- **Correlation IDs**: Generate and track correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Error Types**: Define error types for domain, infrastructure, and presentation layers
- **Error Mapping**: Map Supabase and network errors to domain errors

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Logging utilities with log levels implemented
- [ ] Correlation ID generation and tracking
- [ ] Structured error types defined
- [ ] Error handling utilities created
- [ ] Error mapping utilities for infrastructure errors
- [ ] Environment-based log level configuration
- [ ] Documentation added for logging and error handling

# Type Utilities

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Labels:** setup, typescript, shared, utils  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-40-type-utilities`

## Description

Create common TypeScript utility types and helpers in `shared/utils/` to reduce code duplication and provide reusable type patterns across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have common TypeScript utility types and helpers so that I can reduce code duplication and maintain consistent type patterns across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Utility types file created at `shared/utils/types.ts`
2. Common utility types defined (e.g., `Optional<T>`, `Nullable<T>`, `DeepPartial<T>`, `KeysOfType<T>`)
3. Type helpers for common patterns (e.g., extracting types from arrays, unions, etc.)
4. All utilities properly documented with JSDoc
5. Utilities are generic and reusable across different domains

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Type utilities in `shared/utils/types.ts` can be imported by all layers
- **Generic Types**: Utilities should be generic and work with any type
- **Type Safety**: All utilities should maintain TypeScript type safety
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments explain usage and examples

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Utility types file created
- [ ] Common utility types implemented
- [ ] Type helpers for common patterns
- [ ] All utilities properly documented with JSDoc
- [ ] Examples provided in documentation
- [ ] No duplication of existing TypeScript utility types

## Related Components

- `shared/utils/types.ts`
- All files using TypeScript types

# SCSS Variables

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Labels:** setup, styles, design-system, shared  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-34-scss-variables`

## Description

Define comprehensive SCSS variables for the design system including color palette, spacing scale, typography, and breakpoints. These variables will be used throughout the application to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have centralized SCSS variables for colors, spacing, typography, and breakpoints so that I can maintain consistent styling across the application without hardcoding values.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Color palette variables defined in `styles/variables/colors.scss` with primary, secondary, neutral, and semantic colors
2. Spacing scale variables defined in `styles/variables/spacing.scss` with consistent margin, padding, and gap values
3. Typography scale variables defined in `styles/variables/typography.scss` with font sizes, line heights, and font weights
4. Breakpoint variables defined in `styles/variables/breakpoints.scss` for mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. All variables follow SCSS naming conventions and are properly exported for use across the application

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Variables in `styles/variables/*` can be imported by all layers
- **SCSS Structure**: Follow existing structure in `styles/variables/`
- **Design System**: Align with design system documentation in `docs/architecture/design-system.md`
- **Variables Usage**: All hardcoded values in existing components should be replaced with variables

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All variable files created in `styles/variables/`
- [ ] Color palette includes primary, secondary, neutral, and semantic colors
- [ ] Spacing scale follows consistent scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- [ ] Typography scale includes all necessary font sizes and line heights
- [ ] Breakpoints defined for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Variables properly exported and importable
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

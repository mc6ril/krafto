# A11y Constants

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Labels:** setup, accessibility, shared, a11y  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-38-a11y-constants`

## Description

Define accessibility ID generators and ARIA label constants in `shared/a11y/` to ensure consistent accessibility identifiers and labels across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have centralized accessibility ID generators and ARIA label constants so that I can ensure consistent and unique accessibility identifiers without hardcoding them.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Accessibility ID generator function created in `shared/a11y/constants.ts`
2. ARIA label constants defined for common UI patterns (buttons, forms, navigation, modals)
3. Constants for ARIA roles and states
4. ID generator ensures unique IDs and follows naming conventions
5. All constants properly typed and exported

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Constants in `shared/a11y/constants.ts` can be imported by all layers
- **ID Generation**: Use consistent naming pattern (e.g., `getAccessibilityId(key: string): string`)
- **Type Safety**: All constants properly typed with TypeScript
- **Usage**: Components should use these constants instead of hardcoding accessibility strings

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Accessibility ID generator function created
- [ ] ARIA label constants for common patterns
- [ ] ARIA role and state constants
- [ ] All constants properly typed
- [ ] ID generator ensures uniqueness
- [ ] Documentation added for constant usage

## Related Components

- `shared/a11y/constants.ts`
- `shared/a11y/utilities.ts`
- All components using accessibility attributes

# Validation Utilities

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Labels:** setup, validation, shared, utils  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-41-validation-utilities`

## Description

Create validation utilities and error handling helpers in `shared/utils/` to provide reusable validation patterns and consistent error handling across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have validation utilities and error handling helpers so that I can implement consistent validation and error handling without duplicating logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Validation utilities file created at `shared/utils/validation.ts`
2. Common validation functions (email, URL, required, min/max length, etc.)
3. Error handling utilities for formatting and mapping errors
4. Zod integration helpers for common validation patterns
5. All utilities properly typed and documented

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Validation utilities in `shared/utils/` can be imported by all layers
- **Zod Integration**: Utilities should work with Zod schemas used in domain
- **Error Formatting**: Error utilities should format errors consistently for UI display
- **Type Safety**: All utilities maintain TypeScript type safety

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Validation utilities file created
- [ ] Common validation functions implemented
- [ ] Error handling utilities created
- [ ] Zod integration helpers added
- [ ] All utilities properly typed and documented
- [ ] Examples provided in documentation

## Related Components

- `shared/utils/validation.ts`
- `shared/utils/errors.ts`
- `core/domain/*/schemas.ts` (Zod schemas)
- Form components using validation

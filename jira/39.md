# Translation System

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Labels:** setup, i18n, shared, translation  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-39-translation-system`

## Description

Setup i18n translation system with translation files (fr.json) and useTranslation hook. This enables multi-language support and centralizes all user-facing strings.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have a translation system with translation files and a useTranslation hook so that I can manage all user-facing strings centrally and support multiple languages.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. i18n library installed and configured (react-i18next or similar)
2. Translation file structure created with `shared/i18n/messages/fr.json`
3. `useTranslation` hook created in `shared/i18n/` for accessing translations
4. Translation keys follow hierarchical naming convention (namespace.key)
5. Hook provides type-safe translation access with autocomplete

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: i18n system in `shared/i18n/` can be imported by all layers
- **Translation Files**: JSON files in `shared/i18n/messages/` for each language
- **Hook Usage**: Components use `useTranslation()` hook instead of hardcoded strings
- **Type Safety**: Translation keys should be type-checked for autocomplete and error prevention

## Definition of Done

- [ ] i18n library installed and configured
- [ ] Translation file structure created (`shared/i18n/messages/fr.json`)
- [ ] `useTranslation` hook implemented
- [ ] Translation keys follow naming conventions
- [ ] Type-safe translation access with autocomplete
- [ ] Provider setup in root layout
- [ ] Documentation added for translation usage

## Jira Ticket

-   **Title**: B-HOME-04 – Define buyer CTAs (buy vs. sell) and their placement
-   **Type**: Feature
-   **Priority**: High
-   **Story Points**: 3
-   **Area**: Buyer
-   **Sub-area**: Home / Landing
-   **Git Branch**: feat/krafto-4-homepage-buyer-ctas-and-seller-entrypoints

### Description

Define and document the primary and secondary CTAs on the Buyer homepage, clarifying the balance between “buy” actions (explore, compare, purchase) and “sell” actions (onboarding new sellers), and decide where and how entry points to seller onboarding should appear without diluting the core Buyer journey.

### User Story

As a buyer arriving on the Krafto homepage,  
I want clear primary and secondary CTAs that guide me toward exploring and using the catalog, while keeping any “sell on Krafto” entry points visible but non-intrusive,  
so that I can quickly act on my buying needs without confusion, and sellers still have a clear path to get started when relevant.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **CTA landscape and hierarchy**

    - A complete list exists of all homepage CTAs relevant to Buyers and Sellers (e.g., explore catalogs, see how Krafto works, talk to us, become a seller).
    - For each CTA, the primary target audience (Buyer vs. Seller vs. neutral) and main goal are explicitly documented.
    - A clear hierarchy is defined (primary vs. secondary vs. tertiary CTAs) and mapped to the homepage sections defined in previous tickets.

2. **Primary Buyer CTAs (buy-side)**

    - The primary Buyer CTAs for the homepage are decided and documented (e.g., “Explore catalogs”, “See how Krafto works”), including where they appear (hero, repeated lower on the page).
    - It is clear which CTAs are considered primary vs. supporting for the Buyer journey and how often they may be repeated without creating noise.
    - The relationship between Buyer CTAs and the main discovery sections (featured artisans, categories, collections) is described.

3. **Seller entry points and placement**

    - All entry points to seller onboarding (e.g., “Sell on Krafto”, “Become a supplier”) are identified and documented with their intended location(s) on the homepage (or decision to avoid them on the Buyer homepage).
    - Rules are defined for how seller-focused CTAs should appear relative to Buyer-focused CTAs (e.g., visually secondary, in header/footer, or in a distinct informational block).
    - Any conditions or future plans for when to introduce or move seller onboarding CTAs (e.g., MVP vs. later phases) are documented.

4. **Conflict and dilution safeguards**

    - The document provides guidelines to avoid confusing or overloading the homepage with competing CTAs (e.g., not mixing strong “Buy” and “Sell” CTAs in the same visual block).
    - It is clear how to avoid situations where seller onboarding CTAs distract from the primary Buyer journey (e.g., limits on prominence, frequency, or placement).
    - Constraints for future experimentation (e.g., A/B tests) are described so that CTA variants still respect the agreed hierarchy and roles.

5. **Traceability with existing homepage specs**

    - The CTA definitions and placements explicitly reference and remain consistent with:
        - The value proposition and promises defined in B-HOME-01.
        - The homepage sections and flows defined in B-HOME-02.
        - The featured content and editorial rules from B-HOME-03 where CTAs interact with featured sections.
    - Any required updates or clarifications to existing documentation (e.g., `docs/homepage-implementation.md`) are listed as follow-up actions.

### Technical Considerations

-   **Domain / Usecases**
    -   This ticket does not introduce new domain entities or usecases; it clarifies UX flows and CTA semantics that future implementation tickets will rely on.
    -   The outcome should inform future routing and flow design (e.g., which CTAs link to which routes or onboarding flows).
-   **Infrastructure**
    -   No direct infrastructure changes are required in this ticket.
    -   If future experimentation or tracking is expected (e.g., CTA click analytics), this should be noted as a consideration for later tickets.
-   **Presentation**
    -   This ticket defines the CTA strategy and placement rules but does not implement UI; future UI/UX tickets will use this document to place and style CTAs in `src/app` and `presentation/components`.
    -   Accessibility and copy (labels, aria-labels) will be refined in subsequent implementation and design tickets, using the i18n and a11y conventions of the project.

### Definition of Done

-   A written CTA and placement specification exists and is saved in the project documentation (e.g., under `docs/` or `report/planning/`) and linked from this ticket.
-   The specification clearly describes:
    -   All primary and secondary Buyer CTAs on the homepage and their locations.
    -   All entry points (if any) to seller onboarding from the homepage and how they relate visually and hierarchically to Buyer CTAs.
    -   Safeguards to avoid conflicts or dilution between Buyer and Seller journeys on the homepage.
-   The spec is reviewed and validated by product/UX (or equivalent role) to confirm alignment with Buyer goals and broader marketplace strategy.
-   Any follow-up tickets required for routing, UI/UX implementation, or analytics instrumentation of CTAs are identified and referenced from this ticket.

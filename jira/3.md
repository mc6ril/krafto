## Jira Ticket

-   **Title**: B-HOME-03 – Define editorial rules for featured products and shops
-   **Type**: Feature
-   **Priority**: High
-   **Story Points**: 3
-   **Area**: Buyer
-   **Sub-area**: Home / Landing
-   **Git Branch**: feat/krafto-3-homepage-featured-editorial-rules

### Description

Define clear, explicit editorial rules for what can appear in the “featured” areas (products and shops) on the Buyer homepage so that curation is ethical, diverse, transparent, and aligned with Krafto’s positioning, while remaining easy to operate over time.

### User Story

As a buyer visiting the Krafto homepage,  
I want the featured products and shops to reflect ethical, diverse, and up-to-date selections,  
so that I can trust what I see and feel confident that Krafto’s curation is fair and aligned with my values.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Scope and terminology**

    - A clear definition exists of all “featured” surfaces on the Buyer homepage (e.g., hero product, featured products carousel, featured shops/artisans section).
    - For each surface, it is clear whether it highlights products, shops, collections, or mixed content.
    - The editorial rules document explains how each “featured” surface differs from standard listings or search results.

2. **Eligibility rules for featured products**

    - A list of eligibility criteria for products is defined, including at minimum: ethics (e.g., respect of platform guidelines), quality baseline, availability/stock, and basic data completeness (photos, description, price).
    - The rules specify which product metadata or signals are used to decide if a product can be considered for featuring (e.g., recentness, performance, thematic relevance).
    - Non-eligible products (e.g., flagged content, poor quality, incomplete profiles) are explicitly excluded from “featured” surfaces by rule.

3. **Eligibility rules for featured shops**

    - A list of eligibility criteria for shops/artisans is defined, including at minimum: adherence to platform rules, profile completeness, and minimum activity level.
    - The rules cover how to avoid over-exposure of a small subset of shops (e.g., rotation logic, cap per shop, diversity of locations or categories).
    - Shops that are suspended, under review, or non-compliant are explicitly excluded from all “featured” surfaces.

4. **Diversity and fairness criteria**

    - The editorial rules include explicit criteria or guardrails to ensure diversity across featured content (e.g., mix of categories, styles, geographies, and/or artisan profiles).
    - The document describes how to avoid repetitive selection of the same products or shops over time (e.g., rotation windows, maximum repeat frequency).
    - There is a written explanation of how to handle manual overrides while preserving overall fairness (e.g., exceptional campaigns vs. baseline rules).

5. **Recency and freshness**

    - Rules define how recency influences eligibility for being featured (e.g., new arrivals, recently updated shops, seasonal relevance).
    - The minimum and/or maximum age of items or shops for eligibility is documented where relevant.
    - The document explains how often featured content should be reviewed or rotated (e.g., daily, weekly, per campaign).

6. **Operational workflow and ownership**

    - The document specifies who is responsible for curating or validating featured content (e.g., role, not necessarily a named person).
    - A simple workflow is described for proposing, approving, and updating featured products and shops (including how to handle urgent removals).
    - Any dependencies on tooling (e.g., internal back-office, tags, flags) are listed, even if the tooling will be implemented in separate tickets.

7. **Transparency and buyer promise**

    - The editorial rules define how to communicate (if needed) the nature of featured content to buyers (e.g., “editorial selection”, “campaign”, “sponsored” for future cases).
    - Any constraints or non-goals are explicitly listed (e.g., no pay-to-play at this stage, or how sponsorship would be distinguished later).
    - The resulting rules are consistent with the Buyer homepage messaging guidelines and value proposition defined in previous tickets (B-HOME-01, B-HOME-02).

### Technical Considerations

-   **Domain / Usecases**
    -   This ticket defines editorial and governance rules but does not implement selection logic in code.
    -   The output should inform future domain modeling for “featured” flags, eligibility status, diversity signals, and rotation rules.
    -   Future usecases (e.g., `listFeaturedProducts`, `listFeaturedShops`) will rely on the rules defined here to filter and prioritize content.
-   **Infrastructure**
    -   No immediate infrastructure changes are required in this ticket.
    -   Any necessary fields (e.g., flags, tags, status) for expressing eligibility or editorial decisions will be specified for later implementation in Supabase or other data sources.
-   **Presentation**
    -   This ticket does not change the UI directly; it defines the editorial contract that future UI/UX tickets must respect for “featured” areas on the homepage.
    -   Future design and implementation tickets will reference this document to ensure featured sections visually and behaviorally align with the editorial rules.

### Definition of Done

-   A written editorial rules document exists and is saved in the project documentation (e.g., under `docs/` or `report/planning/`) and linked from this ticket.
-   The document clearly describes:
    -   All “featured” surfaces on the Buyer homepage and their purpose.
    -   Eligibility, diversity, recency, and exclusion rules for products and shops.
    -   Operational workflow (roles, review cadence, override handling) for curating featured content.
-   The rules are reviewed and validated by product/brand/UX (or equivalent role) to ensure alignment with Krafto’s values and Buyer expectations.
-   Any follow-up tickets required for tooling, domain modeling, or UI/UX implementation of featured content are identified and referenced from this ticket.

# Component Styles

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Labels:** setup, styles, components, shared  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-36-component-styles`

## Description

Create base component styles for buttons, inputs, and cards. These styles will serve as the foundation for reusable UI components and ensure consistent styling across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have base component styles for buttons, inputs, and cards so that I can create consistent UI components without duplicating styles.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Button styles created in `styles/components/button.scss` with variants (primary, secondary, danger) and states (hover, active, disabled)
2. Input styles created in `styles/components/input.scss` with base input, textarea, and select styling
3. Card styles created in `styles/components/card.scss` with base card container styling
4. All styles use SCSS variables from `styles/variables/*`
5. Styles follow BEM methodology with proper class naming

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Component styles in `styles/components/*` for global component styling
- **SCSS Variables**: All values must use variables (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
- **BEM Naming**: Use kebab-case with `__` for elements and `--` for modifiers
- **Reusable Components**: These styles will be used by reusable components in `presentation/components/ui/`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Button styles with all variants and states
- [ ] Input styles for input, textarea, and select elements
- [ ] Card styles for container components
- [ ] All styles use SCSS variables (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] BEM naming convention followed
- [ ] Styles properly organized in `styles/components/`

# Create Clean Architecture Directory Structure

- Type: Task
- Priority: High
- Story Points: 3
- Labels: setup, architecture, structure
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-10-directory-structure`

## Description

Create the complete Clean Architecture directory structure including core/ (domain/, usecases/, ports/), infrastructure/, presentation/ (components/, hooks/, stores/, providers/, layouts/), shared/, and styles/ directories with proper organization.

## User Story

As a developer, I want the directory structure created so that I can organize code following Clean Architecture principles from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] core/ directory created with domain/, usecases/, and ports/ subdirectories
- [ ] infrastructure/ directory created with supabase/ subdirectory
- [ ] presentation/ directory created with components/, hooks/, stores/, providers/, layouts/ subdirectories
- [ ] shared/ directory created with a11y/, constants/, utils/ subdirectories
- [ ] styles/ directory created with variables/, components/, layout/ subdirectories
- [ ] All directories include .gitkeep files if empty

## Technical Considerations

- Domain: Domain entities and business rules
- Usecases: Business logic orchestration
- Infrastructure: Repository implementations
- Presentation: UI components, hooks, stores
- Structure: Complete Clean Architecture layout

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All directories created
- [ ] Directory structure matches Clean Architecture
- [ ] .gitkeep files added to empty directories
- [ ] Structure documented or self-explanatory
- [ ] No files in wrong locations

## Related Components

- Files: Directory structure (core/, infrastructure/, presentation/, shared/, styles/)

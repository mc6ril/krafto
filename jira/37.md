# A11y Utilities

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Labels:** setup, accessibility, shared, a11y  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-37-a11y-utilities`

## Description

Create accessibility utilities and helper functions in `shared/a11y/` to centralize accessibility logic and ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have centralized accessibility utilities so that I can easily implement accessible features without duplicating accessibility logic across components.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Accessibility utilities directory created at `shared/a11y/`
2. Helper functions for common accessibility patterns (focus management, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
3. Utilities for generating accessibility IDs and labels
4. Functions for managing live regions and announcements
5. All utilities are pure functions with proper TypeScript types

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Utilities in `shared/a11y/` can be imported by all layers
- **Clean Architecture**: Accessibility logic centralized in shared, not in domain/usecases/infrastructure/presentation
- **Type Safety**: All utilities properly typed with TypeScript
- **WCAG Compliance**: Utilities should support WCAG 2.1 AA requirements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `shared/a11y/` directory created with utility files
- [ ] Focus management utilities (trap focus, return focus)
- [ ] ARIA attribute helpers
- [ ] Keyboard navigation utilities
- [ ] Live region management functions
- [ ] All utilities properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] Documentation added for utility usage

# Configure TypeScript, Next.js, and Path Aliases

-   Type: Task
-   Priority: High
-   Story Points: 3
-   Labels: setup, configuration, typescript, nextjs
-   Git Branch: `feat/workbench-1-typescript-nextjs-config`

## Description

Configure TypeScript with strict mode and path aliases, setup Next.js App Router with TypeScript integration, and configure path aliases (@/ for src/) in both tsconfig.json and next.config to enable clean imports across the project.

## User Story

As a developer, I want TypeScript and Next.js properly configured with path aliases so that I can write type-safe code with clean import paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] TypeScript configured with strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json
-   [ ] Path alias @/ configured to point to src/ directory in tsconfig.json
-   [ ] Next.js configured with App Router and TypeScript integration in next.config.ts
-   [ ] Path alias @/ configured in next.config.ts for build-time resolution
-   [ ] TypeScript compiler options optimized for Next.js (target, module, lib)

## Technical Considerations

-   Domain: None
-   Usecases: None
-   Infrastructure: None
-   Presentation: None
-   Configuration: tsconfig.json, next.config.ts

## Definition of Done

-   [ ] Code follows Clean Architecture
-   [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled and passing
-   [ ] Path aliases working in both dev and build
-   [ ] Next.js App Router configured correctly
-   [ ] No TypeScript errors in configuration files

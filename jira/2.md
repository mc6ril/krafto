## Jira Ticket

-   **Title**: B-HOME-02 – Define homepage content sections for Buyer landing
-   **Type**: Feature
-   **Priority**: High
-   **Story Points**: 3
-   **Area**: Buyer
-   **Sub-area**: Home / Landing
-   **Git Branch**: feat/krafto-2-homepage-buyer-messaging

### Description

Define and structure the main content sections of the Buyer homepage so that visitors immediately understand Krafto’s value, discover key artisans and products, and are guided toward primary conversion actions.

### User Story

As a buyer discovering Krafto for the first time,  
I want a clear, well-structured homepage with meaningful sections (hero, featured artisans, categories, collections, trust signals, and CTAs),  
so that I can quickly understand the offer, explore relevant content, and feel confident to take action (browse, sign up, or purchase).

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Hero section**

    - Contains a clear primary headline, supporting subheading, and a primary CTA focused on the main buyer action (e.g., explore artisans or start shopping).
    - Includes an optional secondary CTA aligned with a secondary action (e.g., learn more, view collections).
    - Visually prioritized above the fold for both desktop and mobile.

2. **Featured artisans section**

    - Displays a curated subset of artisans with name, key visual (photo/illustration), and a short positioning element (e.g., specialty, location, or style).
    - Each featured artisan card links to a detailed view or listing that allows buyers to explore more from that artisan.
    - Section includes a visible entry point to “view all artisans” or equivalent broader exploration.

3. **Categories section**

    - Shows a set of main product categories relevant for buyers (e.g., by product type, style, or occasion – to be finalized in a separate ticket if needed).
    - Each category tile/card includes a short label and a visual element or icon.
    - Clicking a category leads to the appropriate listing or filtered browsing experience.

4. **Collections / thematic highlights section**

    - Presents at least one thematic collection or curated selection (e.g., seasonal, best-sellers, new arrivals).
    - Each collection has a short title, short description, and a CTA leading to the full collection.
    - Section visually distinct from the categories to avoid confusion.

5. **Trust signals section**

    - Includes at least two types of trust elements (e.g., testimonials, review score, number of artisans/products, security/payment reassurance, guarantees).
    - Trust elements are written and positioned to support buyer confidence without overwhelming the page.
    - Section is clearly separated from purely commercial content but remains visible before or near key CTAs.

6. **Primary and secondary CTAs**

    - At least one primary CTA is present in the hero and repeated (or complemented) in at least one additional section further down the page.
    - Secondary CTAs (e.g., learn more, browse categories, discover artisans) are clearly labeled and connect to relevant discovery flows.
    - All CTAs are consistent in wording and hierarchy across sections.

7. **Information architecture & consistency**
    - The order of sections follows a coherent buyer journey: hero → credibility and offer overview (featured artisans, categories, collections) → deeper trust signals → reinforced CTAs.
    - Section titles, subtitles, and microcopy are consistent in tone and aligned with Buyer messaging guidelines from `B-HOME-01`.
    - Each section has a clear purpose and can be referenced individually in future design/implementation tickets.

### Technical Considerations

-   **Domain / Usecases**
    -   No new domain logic is required at this stage; this ticket focuses on information architecture and content structure, not implementation.
    -   Resulting section definitions will be used later to guide domain modeling for artisans, categories, collections, and trust entities where relevant.
-   **Infrastructure**
    -   No direct infrastructure work in this ticket; data sources for artisans, categories, collections, and trust signals will be detailed in subsequent implementation tickets.
-   **Presentation**
    -   Output of this ticket should include a clear, documented list of sections with: section name, goal, key content elements, and relationships between sections.
    -   These definitions will be used to create future UI/UX tickets (wireframes, visual design, and implementation in `src/app` and `presentation/components`).

### Definition of Done

-   A written specification exists that:
    -   Lists all homepage sections: hero, featured artisans, categories, collections, trust signals, and CTAs.
    -   Describes for each section: objective, core content elements, and interaction entry points (where the user can go next).
    -   Defines the recommended order of sections for the Buyer homepage.
-   Specification is saved in the project documentation (e.g., under `docs/` or `report/planning/`) and referenced from this ticket.
-   Ticket is reviewed and validated by product/UX (or equivalent role) to confirm the sections align with Buyer needs and overall Krafto positioning.
-   Any follow-up tickets required for design or implementation (e.g., UI wireframes, React components, data modeling) are identified and linked from this ticket.
